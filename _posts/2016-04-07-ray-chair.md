description: 'Ray Chair is a minimalist design created by New York-based designer Lera Moiseeva. The higher a stem of a plant reaches to the light, the deeper its roots grow into the ground. The nature of this chair works according to the same principle; the five legs of the chair work as roots, that give life to the stable and firm seat.'
