description: "No 1 Chair is a minimalist chair designed by Stockholm-based designer Pontus Lomar. The first launch, the No 1 Chair in drawn steel rod, is deceptively simple and light, with a graphic form evoking a hasty pencil sketch. The Butterfly Chair from the 50's, and even the curling smoke from Frank Stella's cigar are among the playful inspirations."
