description: 'Bike is a minimalist design created by Stockholm-based designer Monica Förster. The chair is inspired from the bicycle and sporting worlds and I think it is both Scandinavian and international in its expression. Above all, my ambition was to emphasise the superior handcraft element, with elaborate attention to every detail in the choice of material, the stitching, and other aspects.'
