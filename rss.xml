They may get a little closer, however, now that Google has solved one of their major issues.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/60f00415e118224ecabc9f288eafe337a9d94455.jpg"></article>]]></description>

The first launch, the No 1 Chair in drawn steel rod, is deceptively simple and light, with a graphic form evoking a hasty pencil sketch. The Butterfly Chair from the 50's, and even the curling smoke from Frank Stella's cigar are among the playful inspirations.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/740668cc7a95c209ee74fc296b5c553fbb5054f8.jpg"></article>]]></description>
